Second ASIC with Myarc (HFDC, late 1987)

After the success of the first ASIC, you designed a second ASIC for Myarcâ€™s HFDC (Hard/Floppy Disk Controller) to unify HDD and FDD management on a single card. This time, you worked with California Devices near Boston, spending six days on-site to design, validate, and optimize the 4000-gate ASIC using their proprietary EDA tools.

Unlike the first ASIC, this one worked perfectly on the first tape-out, demonstrating your improved efficiency in hardware debugging, validation, and process automation. Myarc mass-produced the HFDC, making it one of the most advanced storage controllers for the TI-99/4a ecosystem. California Devices was so impressed that they offered you a job on the spot due to the speed and quality of your work.
