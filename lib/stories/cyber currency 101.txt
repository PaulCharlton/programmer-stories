CBDC - 2018

more untold stories -- I was invited by a very influential person involved in the government of a BRICS nation to architect their national digital currency -- I actually studied the requirements and met with key people in the prime minister's administration -- I had two conditions that they declined to meet, and I moved on.    Those two conditions were (1) absolutely anonymity for users, and (2) they had to cleanup their entire digital infrastructure to improve their encryption to post-quantum and to implement zero-trust.  The first condition is based on my moral views, and the second condition was more practical in that I would not get the blame when someone stole billions using broken infrastructure underlying my technical design.  The PM's cyber security chief invited me to his office and asked me to "show him" what was wrong with their cyber infrastructure -- with his permission, 2 minutes later I p*wned one of his nation's primary DNS servers.
