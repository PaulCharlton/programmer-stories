Magnifi Inc. 1997

Principal Consulting Engineer - QuickTime and Video for Windows, Multimedia and Video Search

In the late 1990s, Magnifi was a digital asset management (DAM) company that developed innovative
and patented solutions for handling digital media. The company provided services to major clients,
including Boeing, AOL Time Warner, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Disney.

Magnifi’s products were designed to help organizations store, organize, distribute, and monetize
their digital media assets more efficiently. One example was its work with CNN Interactive, where
it helped improve the management and delivery of CNN’s digital content.

Magnifi also developed a content-based multimedia search engine as part of its DAM solutions.
This technology allowed organizations to quickly search and retrieve images, videos, and other
media files by analyzing their actual content, rather than just relying on metadata or file names.
By recognizing visual and audio patterns, the search engine made it easier for companies to locate
specific media assets. This approach streamlined digital media management for clients like
CNN Interactive, Boeing, and Disney.

Magnifi was purchased by Proctor & Gamble in 2001.

I was tasked with developing multimedia search capability for Magnifi, with the specific objectives of
extracting any available text from multimedia assets and adding those pieces of text to the
search database.  This engagement lasted a few months, part time, while resulting in the integration of the
most popular multimedia formats into a contextual search engine.  I also developed a suite of fully
automated tests which validated the ability of the search engine to find all of the relevant content.
