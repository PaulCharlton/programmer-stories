Paul provided excellent support to the Training Directorate during the period from February 2012 to May 2012 as he played a critical role in the successful migration and upgrade to our Learning Management System of environment within a very tight 80-day time frame. His project management leadership and technical web and database developer skills ensured that over 30 legacy courses and 4,000 users were able to be migrated with minimal downtime. In addition he was able to significantly improve the overall user experience by employing web services to allow users to log in via their current credentials instead of requiring a additional credentials as had been required in the previous system. His efforts were the basis for a robust, stable, and critical training platform that was a key resource for the organization.

The person who first introduced Paul to me said that Paul is a "walking MSDN." I think that really reflects the wealth of technical knowledge he has. From all of my past interactions with him, he was able to directly or point to a clear direction to solve any issue that was thrown at him. But more than just a technical guru, he has consistently demonstrated the ability to mentor people around him to be better, the courage to challenge and find better ways to do things, and most importantly, to keep the line of sight straight and solve for the problem with the biggest impact. His leadership has made seemingly impossible task to improve QuickBooks performance a reality.

He is very conceptual and results-oriented.

Paul is one of the most knowledgeable architects I know. He has extensive knowledge of operating systems, networking, databases, and general software development practices. He has helped me solve several seemingly impossible bugs, and has guided me in designing my software projects. Paul shares his knowledge by giving suggestions that help you figure out the solution for yourself, rather than by telling you the answer, which greatly enhances the learning process for less experienced engineers. In addition, his knowledge of the business and insight into the customer experience makes him a valuable asset to any team that he is a part of. I highly recommend Paul.
